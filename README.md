## Ideal Parent Protocol: Assistant

This project is part of the Bolt.new Hackathon 2025. 

This app is meant to help day to day wellness in:

Stress reduction: It can lower physiological arousal and activate the parasympathetic nervous system.

Sleep support: A secure internal state can promote better sleep.

Self-esteem and motivation: Feeling "held" or cared for, even internally, can foster resilience and motivation.

Better relationships: Internalizing secure models can improve how you relate to others.

Somatic wellness: As the nervous system calms, some users report fewer somatic symptoms like headaches, muscle tension, or fatigue.


We are leveraging the strength of A.I. in regards to human well-being. It is designed to be a simple and straightforward way to start or end your day with.
